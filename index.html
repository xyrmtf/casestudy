<p class="aboutpara">My name is Daniel Nick R. Roxas. I was born on September 10, 2006, in Cabanatuan City, specifically in Hilltop Subdivision. I’ve always been raised to be kind and respectful to others, which is something I try to live by every day.<br/>
I’m currently 18 years old and studying at NEUST, taking up BSIT even though I didn’t take the ICT strand before, I’m pushing through and making it work as a skill of mine. On a typical day, you’ll probably catch me playing Roblox, watching movies or anime, or diving into some manga or manhwa when I’ve got nothing left to binge.<br/>
What keeps me going? Just the idea of living a chill life whether that means having fun or taking things seriously when needed.</p>
