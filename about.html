<h1 class="center">Biography</h1>
<p class="aboutpara">My name is Daniel Nick R. Roxas, and I’m currently a student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I was born on September 10, 2006, and I live in Hilltop Subdivision, Cabanatuan City.
<br/>
As someone deeply interested in technology, I’m focused on building a strong foundation in IT, continuously learning and exploring areas that will help me grow in the field. Outside of academics, I keep myself active through regular workouts, and I also enjoy playing games and watching various content to unwind and stay inspired.
<br/>
I’m committed to developing both personally and professionally, with the goal of making a meaningful impact in the tech industry in the future.</p><hr/>
